In progress.
Will eventually sync Outlook Tasks with Google Tasks in a similar way to Google Calendar Sync.

Depends on Google's Python API and a few other things to be added.

Dependencies:
Microsoft Outlook (obviously?)
Python 2.7: 					http://www.python.org/download/
Python for Windows Extensions:	http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/
Google Python API:				http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/.



Note: If using x64 version of python you may need to instal setup tools, see below for more details:
